# What is RESTuino?

In embedded development, we have `Arduino` and `CircuitPython` as software initiatives to improve development productivity. Today, a new standard in embedded development is born. 
It is the `RESTuino`, interactive embedded development firmware for ESP32.

I created an external API layer for the hardware abstraction layer to enable GPIO operations from outside the microcontroller.
In this case, I created `RESTful API` for the `Arduino` hardware abstraction layer inside the `ESP32` microcontroller to enable GPIO operations.

Specifically, you can specify a GPIO number in the URL, `POST` to define a pin state (digitalWrite, digitalRead, etc.), `PUT` to update the value (digitalWrite to HIGH, LOW, etc.), `GET` to get current information, `DELETE` to disable a pin state. And if you do `save`, the pin state is saved in EEPROM, so it is easy to operate as client-side software in IoT.

        ```

# Installation
1. Clone this repository.
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/takeyamayuki/RESTuino.git
    ```
1. Define `ssid`, `password` of your wifi router by changing [ssid_define.cpp](src/ssid_define.cpp).
    ```sh
    $ cd RESTuino
    $ vi src/ssid_define.cpp
    ``` 
    Change `*ssid_def[]`, `*ssid_pass[]` to your wifi SSID, password and `len_ssid` to the number of ssid, password sets you defined.
    ```cpp 
    uint8_t len_ssid = 2;
    const char *ssid_def[] = {"ssid1", "ssid2"};
    const char *ssid_pass[] = {"pass1", "pass2"};
    ```
1. If more than one RESTuino is to be installed, change `host_name`([here](https://github.com/takeyamayuki/RESTuino/blob/main/src/restuino_func.cpp#L4)).
    ```sh
    $ vi src/main.cpp
    ``` 
    ```diff 
    static const char *host_name = 
    -  "restuino"; 
    +  "restuino2"; 
    ```
<!-- 
1. Clear EEPROM.
    ```sh
    # for esp32-devkit
    $ pio run -e esp32dev-setup -t upload
    # for MH ET LIVE ESP32DevKIT
    $ pio run -e mhetesp-setup -t upload
    ``` -->

4. Build and upload [RESTuino](src).
    ```sh
    # for esp32-devkit
    $ pio run -e esp32dev -t upload
    # for MH ET LIVE ESP32DevKIT
    $ pio run -e mhetesp -t upload
    ```

5. Clear EEPROM.

    Initialize the RESTuino system when you see `WiFi connected.` on the serial monitor.
    
    ```sh
    $ curl restuino.local/ -X DELETE  
    Change all pins to nan status...  
    ```  

6. Use this the way you want to use it.


# Usage

1. Specify the GPIO number in the URL
2. `POST` to define the pin status (digitalWrite, digitalRead, etc.)
3. `PUT` to update the value (HIGH for digitalWrite, etc.)
4. `GET` to obtain current information (digitalRead, etc.)
5. `DELETE` to disable the pin status

> **Note**   
> When sending the request body, always specify `Content-Type: text/plain` as the header.

## Control GPIO

### URL

http://restuino.local/gpio(pin_number)     

(pin_number) is the pin number of the GPIO. For example, `http://restuino.local/gpio15` is the GPIO15 of ESP32.  
It is recommended to use `http://restuino.local` instead of accessing the IP address, because of the heavy use of `ESP.restart()` in the RESTuino process.

Specify the target GPIO pin by URL. 

### POST 
Use `POST` to set the status of a pin.       

Request body: `digitalRead` | `digitalWrite` | `analogRead` | `ledcWrite` | `Servo` | `(touch)` | `(dacWrite)`

```sh
# e.g. digitalWrite
$ curl restuino.local/gpio15 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d 'digitalWrite'
digitalWrite
```

### PUT

Use `PUT` to change or define the output value of any pin.  
The following request body can be sent when the GPIO pin set by `POST` is in the following state.

- `digitalWrite`

    Request body: `HIGH` | `LOW` | `0` | `1`  

    ```sh
    # e.g.
    $ curl restuino.local/gpio15 -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d 'LOW'
    LOW
    ```

- `ledcWrite` (alternative to `analogWrite` in esp32)  

    Request body: `0~256 numbers`  

    ```sh
    # e.g.
    $ curl restuino.local/gpio15 -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d '100'
    100
    ```

- `Servo`  
    Request body: `0~180 numbers` | `switch`

    - `0~180 numbers`: a servo motor moves to the angle specified by value.  
    - `switch`: Each time the following command is sent, the servo motor moves back and forth between `angle` and `angle0`.  
    
    ```sh
    # e.g.
    $ curl restuino.local/gpio15 -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d '88'
    88
    ```

### GET

Use `GET` to get the status of any pin.   
The following response body is received when the pin set by `POST` is in the following state.

- `analogRead`: `0~4095 numbers`
- `digitalRead`: `0` | `1`
- `Servo`: `0~180 numbers`

```sh
# e.g. digitalRead
$ curl restuino.local/gpio1 -X GET
0
```

### DELETE

Use `DELETE` to disable any pin (actually, save the setting in EEPROM and restart).

```sh
# e.g.
$ curl restuino.local/gpio1 -X DELETE
Change the pin to nan status... 
```


## Control of the entire system

### URL
- http://(IP_address)   
    The IP address can be obtained via serial communication or `http://restuino.local` via `GET` method (It's easy with a browser).   
    It is recommended to use `http://restuino.local` instead of accessing the IP address, because of the heavy use of `ESP.restart()` in the RESTuino process.

- http://restuino.local


### PUT

Request body: `save` | `load` | `reboot` 

- `save`: Save the current GPIO setting status to EEPROM.   
- `load`: Load GPIO settings stored in EEPROM and reflect to actual pin settings.
- `reboot`: Reboot ESP32.

> **Note**   
> The `load` is done automatically at startup, but the user must `save` before turning off the power.  
> When operating as an IoT client, once the pin state is saved, it will be saved in eeprom, so there is no need to `save` after that.

```sh
# e.g.
$ curl restuino.local/ -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d 'save'
Wrote
```

### GET

Obtain IP address and GPIO status. GPIO status is output in chunks of 40. Starting from the first left digit, GPIO0, 1,2.... and its value is defined as follows.
```sh
$ curl restuino.local/ -X GET
{
  "IP address": "192.168.0.29",
  "GPIO status": "2000000050000002200000000000000000000000"
}
```

|  number  |  meaning  |
| ---- | ---- |
|  0  |  nan  |
|  1  |  digitalread  |
|  2  |  digitalwrite  |
|  3  |  analogread  |
|  4  |  ledcwrite  |
|  5  |  servo  |
|  6  |  (touch)  |
|  7  |  (dacwrite)  |

e.g.   
Looking at the first digit of GPIO status(GPIO0), there is a number 2, which means `digitalwrite`. Therefore, `pinMode(0,OUTPUT)` is executed internally so that `GPIO0` becomes `digitalwrite`.

### DELETE

Disable all pins (actually, save the setting in EEPROM and restart).

```sh
$ curl restuino.local/ -X DELETE
Change all pins to nan status...
```

### POST

Not defined.

## [homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge)

[homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API. This allows you to use iOS apps to control devices that do not natively support HomeKit.

In the homebridge config editor, add the following to the `accessories` section:
```json
"accessories": [
    {
        "accessory": "CMD",
        "name": "light",
        "on_cmd": "curl restuino.local/gpio15 -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d '56'",
        "off_cmd": "curl restuino.local/gpio15 -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d '6'"
    }
]
```
